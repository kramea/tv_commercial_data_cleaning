# Data Cleaning: Converting key-pair values to data frame

This repo contains a IPython notebook that illustrates a simple data cleaning script to covert the data given in key-value pairs (eg. in this format a:124 b:235) to a dataframe. For this, I am using the TV News Channel Commercial Detection Dataset Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/TV+News+Channel+Commercial+Detection+Dataset

The dataset consists of different attributes of the video clips ranging from shot length to spectrum analysis values. It consists of data from 5 TV channels. Each video classifies whether the data is a commercial or not in its first column (1/-1).

For more detailed description on the data contents, see the readme_from_UCI_Repository.txt file.
